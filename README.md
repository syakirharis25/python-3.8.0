## Introduction
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

## Python principle
Beautiful is better than ugly. <br />
Explicit is better than implicit. <br />
Simple is better than complex. <br />
Complex is better than complicated. <br />
Flat is better than nested. <br />
Sparse is better than dense. <br />
Readability counts. <br />
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. <br />
Although practicality beats purity. <br />
Errors should never pass silently. <br />
Unless explicitly silenced. <br />
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. <br />
There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it. <br />
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. <br />
Now is better than never. <br />
Although never is often better than right now. <br />
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. <br />
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. <br />
Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!
